## Loading and preprocessing the data

###1) Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")ï¿½

#Processing the data#

activity$day <- weekdays(as.Date(activity$date))

activity$DateTime<- as.POSIXct(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

###2) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day#


sumTable <- aggregate(activity$steps ~ activity$date, FUN=sum, )
colnames(sumTable)<- c("Date", "Steps")
hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day")

###3) Mean and median number of steps taken each day


###Mean
as.integer(mean(sumTable$Steps))

###Median
as.integer(median(sumTable$Steps))

####The average number of steps taken each day was 10766 steps.
####The median number of steps taken each day was 10765 steps.



## What is the average daily activity pattern?

library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)

####Taking out NAs
clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]

####create average number of steps per interval
intervalTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))

####Create line plot of average number of steps per interval
p <- ggplot(intervalTable, aes(x=interval, y=Avg), xlab = "Interval", ylab="Average Number of Steps")
p + geom_line()+xlab("Interval")+ylab("Average Number of Steps")+ggtitle("Average Number of Steps per Interval")


####5) The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

####Maximum steps by interval
maxSteps <- max(intervalTable$Avg)

####Which interval contains the maximum average number of steps
intervalTable[intervalTable$Avg==maxSteps,1]

####The maximum number of steps for a 5-minute interval was 206 steps.
####The 5-minute interval which had the maximum number of steps was the 835 interval.


#### Imputing missing values

####6) Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

####Number of NAs in original data set
nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])

####The total number of rows with steps = 'NA' is 2304.

####The strategy for filling the 2304 NAs: substitute the missing steps with the average 5-minute 
####(contd.)interval based on the day of the week.

#### Create the average number of steps per weekday and interval
avgTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval, day), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))

#### Create dataset with all NAs for substitution
nadata<- activity[is.na(activity$steps),]

#### Merge NA data with average weekday interval for substitution
newdata<-merge(nadata, avgTable, by=c("interval", "day"))

####Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
#### Reorder the new substituded data in the same format as clean data set
newdata2<- newdata[,c(6,4,1,2,5)]
colnames(newdata2)<- c("steps", "date", "interval", "day", "DateTime")

#### Merge the NA averages and non NA data together
mergeData <- rbind(clean, newdata2)

####7) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
####Create sum of steps per date to compare with step 1
sumTable2 <- aggregate(mergeData$steps ~ mergeData$date, FUN=sum, )
colnames(sumTable2)<- c("Date", "Steps")

#### Mean of Steps with NA data adjusted
as.integer(mean(sumTable2$Steps))

#### Median of Steps with NA data adjusted
as.integer(median(sumTable2$Steps))


#### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

#### Creating the histogram of total steps per day, categorized by data set to show impact
hist(sumTable2$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="Blue")
hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="Light Blue", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed Data", "Non-NA Data"), fill=c("Blue", "Light Blue") )


####The new mean of the imputed data is 10821 steps compared to the old mean of 10766 steps. 
####Contd...That creates a difference of 55 steps on average per day.
####The new median of the imputed data is 11015 steps compared to the old median of 10765 steps. 
####Contd....That creates a difference of 250 steps for the median.
####However, the overall shape of the distribution has not changed.



####8) Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

####Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" 
####contd...indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

####Create new category based on the days of the week
mergeData$DayCategory <- ifelse(mergeData$day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")


library(lattice)

####Summarize data by interval and type of day
intervalTable2 <- ddply(mergeData, .(interval, DayCategory), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))


####Plot data in a panel plot
xyplot(Avg~interval|DayCategory, data=intervalTable2, type="l",  layout = c(1,2),
       main="Average Steps per Interval Based on Type of Day", 
       ylab="Average Number of Steps", xlab="Interval")

####Yes, the step activity trends are different based on whether the day occurs on a weekend or not. 
####contd...This may be driven by extended opportunity for activity beyond normal work hours in weekends
